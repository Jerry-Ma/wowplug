    scan:
    
        Scan <dir> to get a list of installed addons. If no <dir> is
        given, try to scan the previously scanned one if applicable.
    
        Usage:
            wowplug scan [<dir>] [--output=<file>]
    
        Options:

                                This file can be used for `sync`.
    sync:
    
        Sync the addons listed in <file> to an AddOns directory. If
        no <file> is given, sync the previously synced one or the one
        generated by the last run of `scan`. Addons that are not in the
        list will be moved to directory `wowplugcache`. Addons that
        are in the list but do not exist in the AddOns directory or
        `wowplugcache` will be downloaded and installed.

                                Sync to the set <dir> instead of the
                                `config.scan.dir` specified in <file>.
    clean:
    
        Sync the <file> as if all addons listed in <file> were
        disabled. This will move all addons to `.wowplugcache`
